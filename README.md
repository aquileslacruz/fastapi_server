## Description
This is a server for an example Chrome Extension.

The extension allows users to post whenever they drink water. Follow other users and be followed. It should notify users whenever someone they follow takes a drink as well.

## Install && Run
'''docker-compose up --build'''
That command will expose the server on http://localhost:8000 and using the create_users.py create a couple of example users
to fill the database.
